This is a POC project that dmonstrates how you can create an app which is fully serverless. And by serverless, we mean - no server at all!
Instead, we've created the full server architecture in the browser.

## Watermark app
The watermarking up is a good demonstartion of the abilities of this server in the client architecture. It requires:
* Highly available server
* Work offline
* Consistent Data
* Upload / Download Files
* Background operations

You can see this full functioning app [here](http://akiriati.github.io/Server-In-Client)
